# ðŸ“š Online Book Store ðŸ“š
The Online Bookstore Management System is an application that not only provides a seamless experience for shoppers and managers but also prioritizes security through the implementation of authentication and authorization functionalities using JWT tokens. Shoppers can easily join, explore books, manage their shopping carts, make purchases, and review order history. Meanwhile, managers have the tools to efficiently arrange books, organize categories, and oversee order statuses. This project aims to create a user-friendly API that enhances the online book-buying experience while streamlining management tasks for administrators.
